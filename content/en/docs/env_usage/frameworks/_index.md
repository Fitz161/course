In traditional chip verification practices, frameworks like UVM are widely adopted. Although they provide a comprehensive set of verification methodologies, they are typically confined to specific hardware description languages and simulation environments. Our tool breaks these limitations by converting simulation code into C++ or Python, allowing us to leverage software verification tools for more comprehensive testing.
Given Python's robust ecosystem, this project primarily uses Python as an example, briefly introducing two classic software testing frameworks: Pytest and Hypothesis. **Pytest handles various testing needs with its simple syntax and rich features**. Meanwhile, **Hypothesis enhances the thoroughness and depth of testing by generating test cases that uncover unexpected edge cases**.
Our project is designed from the outset to be compatible with various modern software testing frameworks. We encourage you to explore the potential of these tools and apply them to your testing processes. Through hands-on practice, you will gain a deeper understanding of how these tools can enhance code quality and reliability. Let's work together to improve the quality of chip development.
