## 硬件验证

Are there any system requirements for using your project? What languages are supported (if any)? Do users need to already have any software or tools installed?

## Design Under Test

Where can your user find your project code? How can they install it (binaries, installable package, build from source)? Are there multiple options/versions they can install and how should they choose the right one for them?

## Reference Model

Is there any initial setup users need to do after installation to try your project?

## 开始实验

Can your users test their installation, for example by running a command or deploying a Hello World example?
